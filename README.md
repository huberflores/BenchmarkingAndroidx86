Benchmarking Android-x86 through direct Dalvik-x86 invocation
======================

How to compile Android AOSP for x86? or at least a similar Android-based system.

The idea of benchmarking an Amazon instance with Dalvik x86 is to find out the level of concurrency-based QoS that can be achieved in computational offloading operations. 

Dalvik x86 can be created by following these scripts, we encourage to use AOSP code [script 1](https://gist.github.com/huberflores/4687766), [script 2](https://gist.github.com/huberflores/4714824)

Alternatively, we can provide you with an Amazon EC2 Image (AMI) with a running Dalvik x86

Dalvik bytecode execution
=========================

Notice that foo.jar can be foo.apk
